# Automation Scripts

This repository contains a collection of small Bash scripts that I’ve written to automate repetitive tasks and improve my workflow. The scripts are simple, but they’ve helped me save time and stay organized.

## Scripts

### Godot Project Git Repository Updater
A Bash script that automates updating the Git repos for my Godot Projects.

### Oracle Database Auto-Connector
A script that automatically connects to an Oracle Database server and prints its IP address.

All scripts are free to use and modify for personal or professional purposes. Feel free to contribute or create an issue if you have any suggestions or improvements!
